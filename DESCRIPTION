Description: A collection of simple simulation datasets designed for
    generating Nonlinear Dimension Reduction representations
    techniques such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding,
    and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. These
    datasets serve as a valuable resource for understanding the
    reliability of Nonlinear Dimension Reduction representations in various contexts.

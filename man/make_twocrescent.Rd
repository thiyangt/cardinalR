\title{Generate Two-Crescent Shaped Clusters}
\usage{
make_twocrescent(n = c(500, 300), p = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A numeric vector of length 2 specifying the number of
points in each crescent cluster (e.g., `c(500, 300)`).}

\item{p}{An integer greater than 2 specifying the total number of
dimensions. The crescent structure is formed in the first two
dimensions, while higher dimensions remain fixed at zero.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \eqn{n[1] + n[2]} rows and \eqn{p + 1} columns,
  where the first \eqn{p} columns represent coordinates (`x1, ..., xp`)
  and the last column (`cluster`) indicates the cluster label.
}
\description{
This function generates two interlocking crescent-shaped clusters
in a \eqn{p}-dimensional space. The first two dimensions form
the crescent shapes, while additional dimensions (if \eqn{p > 2})
remain as noise-free coordinates (set to zero).

\examples{
twocrescent <- make_twocrescent()
